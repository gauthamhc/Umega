          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Colt. I'm a developer with a serious love for teaching. I've spent the last few years teaching
            people to program at 2 different immersive bootcamps where I've helped hundreds of people become web
            developers and change their lives. My graduates work at companies like Google, Salesforce, and Square.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most recently, I led Galvanize's SF's 6 month immersive program as Lead Instructor and Curriculum Director.
            After graduating from my class, 94% of my students went on to receive full-time developer roles. I also
            worked at Udacity as a Senior Course Developer on the web development team where I got to reach thousands of
            students daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve since focused my time on bringing my classroom teaching experience to an online environment. In 2016 I
            launched my Web Developer Bootcamp course, which has since gone on to become one of the best selling and top
            rated courses on Udemy. I was also voted Udemy’s Best New Instructor of 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've spent years figuring out the "formula" to teaching technical skills in a classroom environment, and I'm
            really excited to finally share my expertise with you. I can confidently say that my online courses are
            without a doubt the most comprehensive ones on the market.
          </p>
          <p>Join me on this crazy adventure!</p>
